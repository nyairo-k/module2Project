# Wordly 📚

Wordly is a simple one-page dictionary app. It helps you look up words, understand their meanings, see examples on how to use in a sentence and keep a list of words they want to remember.

## Features
* **Search:** Find any word and see its definition, part of speech, and how to use it in a sentence.
* **Audio:** Click the audio icon to hear how the word is pronounced.
* **Save Words:** Keep track of your favorite words by clicking the save button.
* **Favorites Menu:** All your saved words stay in a side menu that you can open or close whenever you need it.
* **Fast Experience:** The app works instantly on one page without needing to refresh.


## How to Run the Project
1. Make sure you have the three main files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `index.js`.
2. Place all three files in the same folder on your computer.
3. Open the `index.html` file using any web browser (like Chrome, Safari, or Edge).

## Tools Used
